DDoS attack on federal administration and SBB,2023-06-12,"Russian hackers paralyzed websites of the Swiss Federal Administration and online services of SBB with a distributed denial-of-service attack on Russian National Day.The run of cyber attacks on Swiss institutions continues cheerfully, but this time not with ransomware: Various websites of the Federal Administration were today Monday, 12. June 2023, not reachable, as the responsible Department of Finance informs. The reason is a DDoS attack on the systems of the federal administration, which the specialists there had quickly noticed and taken appropriate measures.The federal portal Admin.ch was not affected, but various online services of the SBB. For example, the website SBB.ch and the ticket purchase via app - but the timetable could be retrieved in the app. The SBB rail service announced in a reply tweet at 9.50 a.m. that ""there is currently a technical problem throughout Switzerland"". Alternatives such as ticket machines or counters should be used.
According to media reports, a Russian hacker group called Noname057(16) is committed to the attack. He upsets the West's support for Ukraine - and the attack started it exactly on the Russian National Day. However, the group is also behind last week's attack on the Swiss parliamentary website Parlament.ch.

This is how Switzerland is preparing for impending Russian cyberattacks,2024-05-07,"Putin's military intelligence service GRU has hacked Germany and other NATO countries. Because of the peace conference on the Bürgenstock, Switzerland is also moving into the focus of pro-Russian hactivists.
9vThe cyber attacks a year ago act as harbingers of pro-Russian attacks that threaten Switzerland when they are on the 15th and 16th. June held its Ukraine peace conference on the Bürgenstock.How did previous cyber attacks go?

The pro-Russian group ""NoName057(16)"" had from the 12th to the 18th June 2023 carried out a total of 57 successful DDoS attacks. In such attacks, hackers try to crash an online service by flooding the IP address of the targeted device with more communication requests than it can procesThe waves of attacks lasted seven days and affected a wide variety of actors: Federal Administration (8 attacks), cantons (5), cities (12), service public companies such as SBB and Post (5), Zurich Airport (12) and the defense company Ruag (1).

The attacks were mild. Switzerland survived it ""without sustainable damage,"" writes the National Center for Cybersecurity (today: Federal Office for Cyber Security) in an analysis from October 2023. ""NoName"" has neither caused reputational damage nor achieved a lower visibility of the websites in the search engines. In part, however, it has achieved two things: higher costs and, possibly, the outflow of technical information.

The attacks were related to parliamentary transactions that ""NoName"" classified as pro-Ukrainian: the re-export of weapons and the video speech of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. When Zelensky visited Bern and the WEF in Davos in January, attacks followed again.What is threatening now because of the peace conference?

On the 15th and 16th In June, Switzerland is holding a peace conference on the Bürgenstock. She has invited 160 states and international organizations to her, but not Russia. This significantly increases the risk of pro-Russian cyber attacks.

The Federal Office for Cyber Security (BACS) is preparing for attacks with the Federal Intelligence Service (NDB) and the Federal Office for Civil Protection. But what exactly threatens Switzerland?

""Conference participants may be exposed to an increased risk of cyber espionage, among other things,"" writes the Federal Office for Cyber Security. Overload attacks (DDoS attacks) can also be expected on IT structures of institutions associated with the conference. ""In addition, hacktivisten could disfigure websites related to the conference."" In the professional world, this is referred to as ""defacement"".

Insiders go even further. Russian hackers could penetrate the Wi-Fi of hotels to listen to conversations, they say. They could also try to disrupt train traffic or air traffic.

The decisive factor should be who attacks Switzerland. Are they pro-Russian hactivists like ""NoName"", hackers who act for political reasons? ""NoName"" has been active since March 2022 and spreads its actions via Telegram. The followers can wish which target should be attacked next. The group wants to generate the highest possible media attention.

Or are they state Russian actors such as ""Fancy Bear""? The group belongs to the Russian military intelligence service GRU. Western intelligence services also refer to it as ""APT 28"" or ""military unit 26165"". ""Fancy Bear"" is responsible for the cyber attack on the German governing and chancellor party SPD, with which e-mail accounts were compromised, as it became known on Friday.What precautions does the Federal Office for Cyber Security take?

No information can be given about the ""concrete defense measures"" ""for security reasons"", it says. However, it emphasizes:

""The IT infrastructures of the Federal Administration as well as the systems of the institutions involved in the organization and implementation of the conference are prepared for the defense against cyber attacks by means of various measures.""
One of these measures is likely to be the preparation for DDoS attacks.

Swiss government and Federal Railways hit by cyberattacks,2023-06-12,"Swiss federal government websites and the online portal of the Swiss Federal Railways have been victims of malicious online attacks.
Several websites of the federal administration are currently unavailable, Swiss public radio, SRF, reported on Monday.
According to the finance ministry, the sites were hit by a so-called DDoS attack, which aims to overload websites and applications with targeted requests so that they are no longer accessible. No data is lost in a DDoS attack.
The pro-Russian hacker group “NoName” has claimed responsibility for the attack on the federal government on its own Telegram channel, Tages-Anzeiger newspaper said. This group was also behind the attack on the Swiss parliament website (www.parlament.chExternal link) last week.
+ Ransomware attacks on the rise in Switzerland
“Federal IT specialists quickly noticed the attack and are taking steps to restore accessibility to websites and applications as quickly as possible,” the finance ministry said on Monday morning.
+ Hackers steal Swiss police and customs data
The Swiss Federal Railways and the Aargau cantonal authorities have also been affected by an earlier online attack against the Bern-based IT company Xplain, which provides services to federal and cantonal departments.
The national railway company and the canton confirmed to the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA that data had been stolen after a ransomware attack. This follows an earlier report in the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper.
The Aargau authorities say “a small volume of operational data linked to error protocols that were analysed at Xplain” is affected by the leak, as well as “commercial correspondence”.
The extent of the data theft is still being analysed by Xplain and the federal authorities. The hackers reportedly used malware to exploit a vulnerability on Xplain servers hosting applications for cantonal services. Ransomware usually blocks all access until a key or an unblocking tool is sent to the victim in exchange for a sum of money.
Far-reaching consequences
The attack on Xplain, revealed on May 23, has had far-reaching consequences. It has affected the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol), the Federal Office of Customs and Border Protection (FOCP) and, according to Le Temps, cantonal police forces. In addition to business correspondence, operational data may also have been affected, according to the National Centre for Cyber Security (NCSC).
After encrypting the stolen data and demanding a ransom from the company, the hackers reportedly published some of the data on the darknet. According to Le Temps, which broke the story, the attack was carried out by the Play group, the same group that recently targeted the Swiss media companies CH Media and NZZ.

Criminals have carried out a cyber attack on SBB,2023-08-02,"Cyber attacks occurred in several countries over the weekend. Now it is clear: SBB was also affected.
Railway operations and customer data were not affected, as the Swiss Federal Railways assure.
The SBB filed a criminal complaint. SBB spokesman Reto Schärli confirms a corresponding report from the online portal Watson to Keystone-SDA. Who is behind the attack, Schärli does not want to comment on this in more detail. There were still clarifications. Together with partners and the federal authorities, the cyber attack will be analyzed.

No danger to the railway system

Cybercriminals therefore spread malware via e-mails at the weekend. The attackers managed to penetrate part of SBB's corporate network.

Because the railway operation had not been affected, the safety of passengers and SBB employees was not endangered, says Schärli. As a precautionary measure, the digital security levels have been increased - to protect SBB and their own individual data. For example, all employees would have had to change their personal password.

There had already been a hacker attack on the SBB website in the spring of 2016, when it was hardly accessible for a short time. However, the attackers had not come close to the security system for train traffic at that time either, it was said.

Hacker attack on federal administration,2023-12-06,"Several websites of the Federal Administration were temporarily no longer accessible.
The reason was a so-called DDoS attack on the systems of the federal administration.
Investigations by the Federal Prosecutor's Office are underway.
The specialists of the Federal Administration had quickly noticed the attack and taken measures to restore the accessibility of the websites and applications as quickly as possible, the Federal Department of Finance (EFD) announced.

The attack apparently applied to the entire federal administration, the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSC) announced on request. At times, a large part of the websites of the federal administration and federal companies as well as several federal applications were not available.

Criminal proceedings against hacker group

The group ""NoName"" has committed itself to the attack online. This group was also behind the attack on parlament.ch that became known last week. The NCSC did not provide any further information on the grouping. According to reports, it is said to be a Russian group. Whether there is a connection with the speech planned for Thursday afternoon by Ukrainian President Volodimir Zelensky before the federal parliament.

Accumulation of cyber attacks
Open the box
The Federal Prosecutor's Office had announced last week that it had opened criminal proceedings due to the attack on the homepage of the parliamentary services. Today's attacks are also the subject of this investigation, the authority announced upon request.

SBB also affected

The SBB was also affected by the DDoS attack. Various online services did not work between about 8 a.m. and 9.45 a.m., as the SBB announced on request. However, the timetable query on SBB Mobile was possible at any time, as was ticket sales via SBB online shop as a guest account, at all ticket machines and in the travel centers.

The problem could be solved in the meantime, SBB announced at noon. All online services would be available normally again.

A DDoS attack (short for Distributed Denial of Service) is about overloading websites and applications with targeted requests in such a way that they are no longer accessible. However, no data flows out.

NoName Attacks Switzerland: A Page Out of State-Sponsored APT Playbook,2023-06-26,"The Swiss parliament website went offline for a few hours on 12 June. Shortly, a message popped up on the Telegram channel of pro-Russian cyber threat actor NoName057(16).

“Bandera member Zelensky thanked Switzerland, which this week joined the 10th package of EU anti-Russian sanctions,” the post said.

“We also ‘thanked’ the Swiss Russophobes and sent DDoS missiles to the website of the Swiss Parliament, after with the resource administrators closed access for foreign ip.”

What followed was a barrage of DDoS attacks on major government and public service websites in Switzerland. Some went offline for a few hours, some as long as two days.

Within a day, websites, including the Swiss Federal Department of Justice and Police, Swiss railway company Südostbahn, Federal Department of Home Affairs, and several other government departments became inactive..

Finally, on June 14, another Telegram post by NoName057(16) disclosed the real reason behind the intensified attacks.

“Tomorrow, Zelensky, a Bandewrist, plans to beg for money via a video chat in the Swiss parliament,” the post said.

The DDoS attacks continued for four more days.
NoName attacks Switzerland
The Swiss finance ministry promptly acknowledged that several federal administration websites were unavailable. However, they refused to either acknowledge that it was a DDoS attack or attribute it to NoName.

Interestingly, the DDoS attacks followed an earlier incident on June 8, where a technology firm called Xplain, which provides government software for various Swiss departments, fell victim to a ransomware attack.

The stolen data was encrypted, and the attackers demanded a ransom.

Some of the compromised data was subsequently posted on the darknet. Xplain serves clients such as the Swiss army and the customs department, providing software for homeland security purposes. The attack was attributed to the Play ransomware group.

According to the claims made on its Telegram channel, there were a total of 60 targets, including national and regional administrations, government departments, and public utilities.

The Swiss administration managed to bring the affected services back and ensure the security and resilience of its systems.

Russia, Ukraine, and the Swiss Connection
Ukraine president Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s address to the Swiss parliament on June 15 called for the unblocking of weapon exports to Ukraine to help restore peace.

He expressed gratitude towards Switzerland for not remaining indifferent to the suffering caused by Russia’s aggression.

He acknowledged Switzerland’s support for the joint European sanctions against Russia, emphasizing the importance of solidarity in bringing an end to the aggression. The President urged for the intensification of sanctions as a means to achieve this goal.

The President acknowledged that Switzerland is currently discussing permits for the re-export of weapons to protect Ukraine.

He urged all participants in the discussion to consider the fact that Ukraine is seeking weapons to restore peace on its territory, in accordance with international law.

“I know that Switzerland is discussing the export of military equipment for the protection and defence of Ukraine. This would be pivotal. We need weapons so that we can restore peace in Ukraine,” the president emphasised.

He highlighted the importance of a rules-based international order that guarantees freedom for every nation, echoing the sentiments expressed by the Speaker at the beginning of the session.

Following President Zelenskyy’s address, Brigitte Häberli-Koller, Head of the Council of Cantons, the upper house of the parliament, reaffirmed Switzerland’s commitment to upholding international law, which recognizes the inherent right of every nation to self-defense.

Why NoName attacked Switzerland?
In this theatre, DDoS attacks seem to be a rather ineffective way to forward one’s cause, you may think. Security researchers say otherwise.

“Cybercriminals like to create confusion – and they sometimes turn to DDoS attacks to distract and misdirect resource-deprived organizations from their primary goal: to pillage sensitive data,” said a Trustwave report on the reasons behind DDoS attacks.

“DDoS attacks are optimal subterfuge because they create noise and chaos that will attract the brunt of attention from your IT staff, leaving wide open the opportunity for your foes to simultaneously infiltrate your network and mask data exfiltration.”

In certain cases, a DDoS attack serves as a digital pretext for a potential physical assault, the report pointed out.

Recently, Trustwave team uncovered a web-based vulnerability in a well-known printer brand, which could potentially lead to denial-of-service attacks.

“Our researchers theorized that attackers could launch the printer attack and show up at the target organization pretending to be the “technician” called to fix the problem,” said the report.

“This impersonation could net them direct physical access to IT resources that they might never have been able to access remotely.”

In this situation, entire Swiss population felt the pinch in some way or the other. Considering NoName’s activities since its inception in March 2022, the threat group is sort of an expert in that.

NoName057(16): An organized collective with a purpose
NoName057(16), commonly referred to as NoName, is a hacktivist group that emerged in March 2022 and has maintained its activity since then. With a pro-Russian stance, the group operates under various aliases, including NoName05716, 05716nnm, and Nnm05716.

According to threat intelligence service SOCRadar, NoName’s actions are driven by a manifesto that responds to those who have openly displayed hostility towards Russia.

The group claims to possess the strength and experience necessary to restore justice and emphasizes the value of truth as a source of power. Financial gain is not their motivation, and they express willingness to collaborate with like-minded groups.

To facilitate their operations, NoName057(16) maintains a private Telegram channel known as the DDosia Project. This platform serves as their communication hub and supports their utilization of the Dosia tool.

Cybersecurity company Avast reported that NoName057(16) continues to engage in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks through their DDosia project, primarily targeting the websites of European institutions and companies.

Their activities align with their support for Russia in the ongoing conflict with Ukraine, suggesting a sustained commitment to their actions throughout the war.

In an effort to incentivize participation, NoName057(16) openly offers cryptocurrency payments to individuals who install their DDosia tool and join the attacks.

Avast’s report indicates that the group is actively striving to enhance the efficiency of their DDoS attacks, with plans to transition to a more effective Go platform after encountering performance limitations with their initial Python-based pilot variant.

Usually, state-sponsored actors seldom claim credit for their actions and go to great lengths to conceal their identities, employing sophisticated techniques to impede attribution efforts. NoName057(16), on the other hand, has no qualms about their Russian affiliation.
NoName057(16) is the latest in the list of state-sponsored threat actors who have been openly launching cyber attack campaigns on their geopolitical rivals.

Among other benefits, cyber mercenaries offer a huge advantage for players: Lack of agency

NoName057(16) and the largest list of Nation State actors
A recent report by the New Yorker highlighted a curious feature of Indian hackers-for-hire: competing firms openly advertising their “ethical” or “white hat” hacking services, and individual hackers boasting about their spear phishing exploits on LinkedIn.

This behavior stands in contrast to cybercriminals in authoritarian nations like Russia, Iran, and North Korea, who prefer to operate discreetly withoutpublic exposure.

Nevertheless, Indian hackers appear to share a significant characteristic with their counterparts in authoritarian countries—an implicit alliance with their government.

According to the report, the top twelve hacking-for-hire firms in India consistently engage in some government-related projects while also undertaking private work.

This pattern has been observed by cybersecurity researchers in both government and private sectors.

Some Indian hacking-for-hire groups are known to transition into activities aligned with the interests of the Indian government, with India’s intense rivalries with China and Pakistan extending to the realm of cyber warfare.

The rise of nation state actors in the cyber landscape poses a significant challenge for governments, organizations, and cybersecurity experts. With their specialized skills, state-sponsored resources, and commitment to anonymity, they represent a formidable force in the evolving field of cyber warfare.

Nation State Actors often have close ties to the military, intelligence, or state control apparatuses of their nations, equipping them with a high degree of technical expertise.

Some are selected for specific language, social media, or cultural skills, enabling them to engage in espionage, propaganda, or disinformation campaigns. With extensive resources and the backing of their governments, they receive instructions from government employees or armed forces members.

Tasked by governments, these skilled individuals employ their expertise to disrupt or compromise target governments, organizations, and even individuals, with the aim of accessing valuable data or intelligence.

Enjoying the tacit support of their respective states, they operate with impunity, shielded from legal consequences in their home countries.

Motivated by nationalism, Nation State Actors harbor a singular objective: to acquire secrets from other nations or disrupt their operations through cyber means.

Their modus operandi involves targeted tasks, such as stealing industrial secrets, sabotaging critical national infrastructure, eavesdropping on policy discussions, dismantling companies that offend their leaders, or launching propaganda and disinformation campaigns within and beyond their nation’s borders.

Social engineering plays a pivotal role, with Nation State Actors employing carefully crafted spear-phishing emails to exploit vulnerabilities in high-profile individuals.

They may also compromise strategic websites to distribute malicious software, ensnaring unsuspecting visitors. Further social engineering tactics, such as creating fake profiles on social networks or infiltrating the supply chains of target organizations, are also utilized.

The formidable capabilities at the disposal of Nation State Actors enable them to execute complex attacks.

For instance, the Stuxnet malware specifically targeted Iran’s nuclear manufacturing facilities, demonstrating the extent of their operations.

Groups like Sofacy and Operation Cleaver have also demonstrated their ability to carry out coordinated attacks against governments and organizations.

The repercussions of their actions can extend to geopolitical consequences, as exemplified by the 2014 cyber attack on Sony Pictures, which prompted the United States to impose sanctions on North Korea.

In addition to their involvement in cyber warfare, Nation State Actors may be tasked with tracking, disrupting, and persecuting dissidents or activists.

Others specialize in propaganda and disinformation campaigns, utilizing armies of trolls to manipulate public opinion and enhance their employer’s reputation.

Industry bodies and think tanks have increasingly become targets of cyber attacks due to the trust they garner from participants in the business and government sectors.

These organizations provide indirect access to sensitive information, making them alluring targets for malicious actors.",The cyber

Switzerland subjected to NoName DDoS attacks,2024-01-18,"Security Affairs reports that Switzerland had some of its government websites temporarily disrupted by a wave of distributed denial-of-service attacks by the pro-Russian hacktivist operation NoName, which noted that the intrusions were in response to the attendance of Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky at the Word Economic Forum in Davos.

While the Swiss government's primary portal was not impacted by the DDoS attacks, threat actors were able to compromise access to the websites of the Swiss Ministry of the Interior, the Swiss cable car network's POOL-ALPIN service provider, and the Rhaetian railway to Davos, as well as the Davos-Klosters ski resort website, according to the country's National Cyber Security Centre, which noted that efforts to restore the impacted sites have been expedited.

Swiss websites hit by DDoS attack ahead of Zelenskiy video address,2023-06-12,"GENEVA, June 12 (Reuters) - Swiss authorities said that several government websites were targeted in a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack on Monday that was claimed by pro-Russian hackers.
The attack comes as the Swiss parliament prepares for a video address by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy scheduled for Thursday and coincides with a national holiday in Russia.
Switzerland's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC), opens new tab said that ""various websites of the Federal Administration and enterprises affiliated with the Confederation were unavailable"" in the wake of the attack, claimed by the NoName hacking group. ""The NCSC is analysing the attack together with the administrative units concerned and defining appropriate measures,"" it said in a statement.
The NCSC, which did not link Zelenskiy's upcoming address to the attack, said the NoName group had also been behind a separate attack against the Swiss parliament's website last week.
In a post on the Telegram messenger service, the group said the attack against the parliament's website last week had been carried out to ""thank Swiss Russophobes"" for adopting another EU sanctions package against Moscow.

Swiss websites hit by DDoS attacks during World Economic Forum in Davos,2024-01-18,"Swiss websites were hit by a wave of distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks this week, likely orchestrated by pro-Russian hackers.

According to the Swiss National Cybersecurity Centre (NCSC), the attacks temporarily disrupted access to several websites run by the Federal Administration — the government's executive branch.

“The cyberattack was promptly detected and the Federal Administration's specialists took the necessary action to restore access to the websites as quickly as possible,” said NCSC’s statement.

DDoS attacks are aimed at making websites unavailable but do not result in any data being lost or compromised.

A Russian politically-motivated hacker group known as NoName claimed responsibility for the attacks on its Telegram channel.

The gang is notorious for its DDoS attacks, primarily targeting financial institutions, government websites, or transportation services in European countries that support Ukraine during its war with Russia. The hackers’ motives align closely with pro-Kremlin interests.

NoName linked its recent attacks on Switzerland to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos.

“While the Davos forum plans to destroy Russia, we have already taken action and are destroying Swiss websites,” the hackers said.

In addition to government websites, they also claimed to have targeted local airports, railways, hotels and restaurants.

Cyberattacks on Switzerland were anticipated leading up to Zelensky's visit, according to the NCSC. The agency claimed to have alerted critical infrastructure operators about the threat, urging them to implement necessary precautions. The Federal Administration had also adopted the required security measures.

“Hackers generally use such attacks on website availability as a means of gaining media attention for their cause,” the NCSC said.

NoName consistently targets Switzerland, citing various reasons for its attacks, including sanctions imposed on Russia, the visits of Swiss state officials to Ukraine and the government and military aid provided to support Kyiv's war efforts.

In total, NoName has likely conducted over 1,500 DDoS attacks since March 2022, according to a recent report.

Several Federal Administration websites disrupted temporarily by DDoS attack,2024-01-17,"Bern, 17.01.2024 - A DDoS attack disrupted temporarily access to a number of websites today, including some belonging to the Federal Administration. The Russian-linked hacker group ‘NoName’ claimed responsibility for the attack, citing Ukrainian President Zelenskyy's attendance at the WEF Annual Meeting. The cyberattack was promptly detected and the Federal Administration's specialists took the necessary action to restore access to the websites as quickly as possible. An attack of this kind had been expected, and appropriate security measures were in place. DDoS attacks are aimed at making websites unavailable. They do not result in any data being lost or compromised.

Several websites run by the Federal Administration were temporarily unavailable to-day, Wednesday 17 January, as a result of a DDoS attack. A DDoS attack occurs when a high volume of requests are sent in order to overload online services. The websites affected included those of the federal departments and a number of federal offices. The Swiss government portal www.admin.ch is still operational.

Responsibility for the attack has once again been claimed by the hacker group ‘NoName’, which previously targeted the Federal Administration in June 2023. The presumed pro-Russian group cited Ukrainian President Zelenskyy’s attendance at the WEF Annual Meeting in Davos as the reason for the DDoS attack.

The NCSC collaborates with the administrative units concerned to analyse the risk of such attacks and provides support in implementing the appropriate measures. As an attack had been expected in the run-up to the visit, the NCSC warned the operators of critical infrastructures of this kind of attack on 10 January and called on them to take the necessary precautions. The Federal Administration had therefore adopted the ap-propriate security arrangements. The NCSC also liaises closely with national and in-ternational partners and with the operators of critical infrastructures.

Hackers generally use such attacks on website availability as a means of gaining me-dia attention for their cause. They do this by flooding a website with a massive volume of requests so as to overload it and make it unavailable for a period of time. No data is lost or compromised in a DDoS attack.

DDoS happens: Swiss cyber security in the Ukraine conflict,2023-07-11,"As a secure hosting provider, we face the challenge of preventing and defending against cyber attacks on a daily basis. A recent NCSC analysis report explains the background and impact of a politically motivated DDoS wave on Swiss organisations.

The National Cyber Security Center (NCSC) has published a detailed analysis of incidents relating to application-layer DDoS attacks on Swiss organisations and authorities in the first two weeks of June 2023.

The masterminds and the context

The report identifies the pro-Russian hacktivist group ""NoName057(16)"" as the perpetrator and highlights its actions. The attacks were caried out following a decision by the Swiss Parliament in connection with the War Material Act in favour of Ukraine and the announcement of an online speech by Ukrainian President Zelenskyi to the Federal Assembly. The actor focused on authorities or organisations that have a certain proximity to the Federal Administration and enjoy a high reputation among the public (e.g. the Swiss Parliament, Swiss Post Ltd and the Swiss Federal Railways SBB).

The report also addresses the geopolitical context of the war in Ukraine and the political motivation of the attackers. The technical part, both in terms of the attack and the defence, is also discussed in comprehensive detail. It comes to the conclusion that conventional anti-DDoS security strategies, which tend to be geared towards volumetric DDoS attacks, are no longer sufficient to protect against application-layer attacks (such as those perpetrated by the current actor). The NSCS believes that organisations have a responsibility to reassess their risk of DDoS attacks as part of a continuous improvement process and to make the necessary adjustments.

Protective measures, awareness and personal responsibility

As a provider of hosting services for business-critical systems, aspectra is confronted with such situations on a daily basis. Internet uplinks, routers, firewalls, WAF and other components as well as resilient application architectures are implemented for prevention. In the event of an attack, the focus is on trained staff who use checklists, experience and dialogue with other stakeholders or the NCSC to weigh up the various measures available and mitigate the attacks.

The involvement of the affected customers and their solutions is also important. The decision to take parts of an application offline globally or locally must ultimately be taken by the affected parties themselves. Accordingly, raising awareness and understanding of the impact of DDoS attacks is an issue for anyone who makes applications available on the Internet.

Imagine the SBB portal being paralysed for a day,2023-06-19,"Switzerland faced a wave of cyberattacks this week, causing disruption to various government websites, city portals, and key platforms like the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), Geneva Airport, and Switzerland Tourism.

Nicolas Mayencourt, cybersecurity specialist and CEO of Dreamlab Technologies provided insights regarding the recent incidents in an interview with Tagesanzeiger.

Mayencourt discussed the increasing threats and the interconnected nature of these attacks. He emphasised the importance of taking preventive measures and drew attention to similar attacks that occurred in other countries during significant events:

“In the past months there were similar attacks in many countries, always exactly when Volodimir Selensky held a speech in the respective country, as now in Switzerland, or when a state, for example, decided to supply weapons to Ukraine. This could be observed in Finland, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Israel. The connection is clear. It was certainly clear to the Swiss authorities that we were exposing ourselves with the speech.”
 

Although Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks may appear technically trivial, they can have devastating consequences, potentially triggering chaos and disrupting vital services:

“At first, it may not sound very dramatic that a website is unavailable. But in the case of large, important websites, it can trigger a national catastrophe. Imagine, for example, that the SBB's online portal is paralysed for a day by a prolonged attack. That could lead to huge chaos and even a collapse of public transport.”
 

He also raised concerns about the emergence of numerous anonymous Twitter accounts spreading fake news, suggesting the possibility of a larger disinformation campaign.

Mayencourt emphasised that cyber risks are often underestimated, citing global statistics on cybercrime damages:

“In general, cyber risks have been greatly underestimated. By way of comparison, according to global insurance statistics, cybercrime causes over $5 trillion in damage worldwide each year. That is around 50 times more than the damage caused by natural events.”
 

When asked about the security of critical institutions like nuclear power plants, Mayencourt cautioned against relying solely on isolation from the internet, citing the recent Mühleberg attack:

“The Mühleberg nuclear power plant, which has since been shut down, was also controlled remotely through a VPN connection. VPN connections are a type of digital tunnel that run over the Internet, and it does not provide robust protection against attackers”.

Imagine that the SBB portal is paralyzed for one day,2023-06-17,"This week's attacks on public platforms could have triggered a national disaster, says cyber specialist Nicolas Mayencourt. And this was just the beginning. Switzerland was repeatedly the target of cyber attacks this week. Several websites of the Federal Administration were temporarily no longer accessible. The same applies to the portals of various cities. Platforms of the SBB, Geneva Airport and Switzerland Tourism were also temporarily down or only worked to a limited extent. In addition, hackers published data stolen by the federal administration on the darknet on the night of Wednesday.Mr. Mayencourt, could the cyberattacks have been prevented this week?

I can't judge how the preparations were designed. It is clear that there were enough signs for interference and sabotage actions. Preventive measures could have already been taken.

Which one?

In recent months, similar attacks have occurred in many countries, and always exactly when Volodimir Zelensky gave a speech in the respective country, as now in Switzerland, or when a state decided, for example, to deliver weapons for Ukraine. This could be observed, for example, in Finland, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Israel. The connection is clear. It was certainly clear to the Swiss authorities that we were exposing ourselves with the speech. To be honest, I am surprised that the federal government and other institutions have now been caught on the wrong foot.

The attacks were mainly that the attackers sent x-thousands of requests to websites in a short time until they collapsed. Is it even possible to defend oneself against it?

There are commercially available and established defense tools. It does not paint a good picture that a country like Switzerland, which wants to be among the world's top in research and technology, was not better prepared.

But the other countries obviously didn't do better either.

Yes, many just do. It can be assumed that those countries in which Selenksi gave a speech without attacks, such as Austria, had a functioning defensive device.How dangerous are such so-called DDoS attacks?

Although they are technically relatively banal, they can have devastating consequences. It may not sound very dramatic at first that a website is not available. For large, important websites, however, this can trigger a national disaster. Imagine, for example, that the online portal of the SBB is paralyzed for a day by a longer-lasting attack. This can lead to a huge chaos up to a collapse of public transport. With the attacks this week, it must be assumed that they were not a singular act, but part of a larger attack. To what extent?

There is an obvious connection between this week's DDoS attacks and the data stolen from various federal offices a few days earlier. Behind the data theft is the hacker group Play, and the group NoName committed itself to the DDoS attacks. Both groups are foreign players from the same region. In addition, in recent days, a conspicuously high number of new, anonymous Twitter accounts relating to Switzerland have appeared, spreading fake news.According to several sources, the cyber attackers come from Russia. Do you assume that they are engaged by Putin?

I don't want to comment on that. The two hacker groups are independent. Their goal is to earn money with their actions. It is clear that they also accept orders from a government if they are paid for them.

Do you think that the attacks of the last few days were just the beginning of something bigger?

That's what I assume. An indication of this are also these mysterious anonymous Twitter accounts, which suddenly appear in large numbers. That's a hint. Hackers and trolls from the same corner could try to launch a larger disinformation campaign after Selenski's speech. This is also shown by the experience in other countries.

Since the pandemic, Switzerland has been criticized for being digitally backward. Is it also about cybersecurity?

Switzerland is not doing very well. There is an international ranking for cyber-readiness. Switzerland is in 42nd place there. For a highly developed country like Switzerland, this is a very bad rating. The ranking is maintained by the International Telecommunication Union, an institution of the UN.How big is the threat actually?

In general, cyber risks are still severely underestimated today. A comparison: According to global insurance statistics, cybercrime causes damage of over 5 trillion dollars worldwide per year. This is about 50 times more than that caused by natural events. In addition, it must be known that the number of hacker attacks since the pandemic is no longer increasing linearly, but virtually exponentially. I attribute this to the fact that since Corona, many more people have been working from home and using their private, less well-protected computers. They are an ideal attack surface for hackers.

It is well known that SMEs are often victims of hacker attacks. Are at least safety-relevant institutions such as nuclear power plants in Switzerland safe?

I don't know a single area in Swiss cyberspace where I would put my hand in the fire that it is really 100 percent protected.

So also not the nuclear power plant?

Unfortunately, history shows that even nuclear plants are not safe from cyber attacks. A few years ago, hackers managed to penetrate Iran's nuclear program on behalf of the USA. Among other things, they manipulated the uranium processing plants.

And in Switzerland? You can protect nuclear power plants from cyber attacks by simply not connecting the security-relevant control devices to the Internet.

Unfortunately, you can't rely on it either. The now decommissioned Mühleberg nuclear power plant was also controlled remotely by a VPN connection. VPN connections are a kind of digital tunnel that run over the Internet. They do not offer very good protection against attackers.",,,weeks attacks public platforms could triggered national disaster says cyber specialist nicolas mayencourt beginning switzerland repeatedly target cyber attacks week several websites federal administration temporarily longer accessible applies portals various cities platforms sbb geneva airport switzerland tourism also temporarily worked limited extent addition hackers published data stolen federal administration darknet night wednesdaymr mayencourt could cyberattacks prevented week cant judge preparations designed clear enough signs interference sabotage actions preventive measures could already taken one recent months similar attacks occurred many countries always exactly volodimir zelensky gave speech respective country switzerland state decided example deliver weapons ukraine could observed example finland poland hungary slovakia israel connection clear certainly clear swiss authorities exposing speech honest surprised federal government institutions caught wrong foot attacks mainly attackers sent xthousands requests websites short time collapsed even possible defend oneself commercially available established defense tools paint good picture country like switzerland wants among worlds top research technology better prepared countries obviously didnt better either yes many assumed countries selenksi gave speech without attacks austria functioning defensive devicehow dangerous socalled ddos attacks although technically relatively banal devastating consequences may sound dramatic first website available large important websites however trigger national disaster imagine example online portal sbb paralyzed day longerlasting attack lead huge chaos collapse public transport attacks week must assumed singular act part larger attack extent obvious connection weeks ddos attacks data stolen various federal offices days earlier behind data theft hacker group play group noname committed ddos attacks groups foreign players region addition recent days conspicuously high number new anonymous twitter accounts relating switzerland appeared spreading fake newsaccording several sources cyber attackers come russia assume engaged putin dont want comment two hacker groups independent goal earn money actions clear also accept orders government paid think attacks last days beginning something bigger thats assume indication also mysterious anonymous twitter accounts suddenly appear large numbers thats hint hackers trolls corner could try launch larger disinformation campaign selenskis speech also shown experience countries since pandemic switzerland criticized digitally backward also cybersecurity switzerland well international ranking cyberreadiness switzerland 42nd place highly developed country like switzerland bad rating ranking maintained international telecommunication union institution unhow big threat actually general cyber risks still severely underestimated today comparison according global insurance statistics cybercrime causes damage 5 trillion dollars worldwide per year 50 times caused natural events addition must known number hacker attacks since pandemic longer increasing linearly virtually exponentially attribute fact since corona many people working home using private less wellprotected computers ideal attack surface hackers well known smes often victims hacker attacks least safetyrelevant institutions nuclear power plants switzerland safe dont know single area swiss cyberspace would put hand fire really 100 percent protected also nuclear power plant unfortunately history shows even nuclear plants safe cyber attacks years ago hackers managed penetrate irans nuclear program behalf usa among things manipulated uranium processing plants switzerland protect nuclear power plants cyber attacks simply connecting securityrelevant control devices internet unfortunately cant rely either decommissioned mhleberg nuclear power plant also controlled remotely vpn connection vpn connections kind digital tunnel run internet offer good protection attackers
