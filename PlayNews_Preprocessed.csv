SBB and Canton of Aargau are also affected by hacker attack,2023-06-11,"The Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and the canton of Aargau are affected by the cyber attack on the company Xplain. Data from both bodies have been stolen, as the SBB and the canton of Aargau announced on Sunday at the request of the Keystone-SDA news agency. The NZZ on Sunday has on the 11th. June reported on it. Data had been drained as part of a data leak, according to SBB. The canton of Aargau also confirmed that it was affected by the attack on the IT service provider Xplain. A spokeswoman for the canton said on request: ""According to today's state of knowledge, we assume that in addition to business correspondence, a small volume of operational data from error logs that were at Xplain for analysis is also affected.""
The exact scope of data theft will be further analyzed internally as well as by Xplain and federal agencies, it continued. Among other things, Xplain has developed applications for the cantonal enforcement services.

The attackers used a vulnerability on Xplain's servers, which housed this data. It is a so-called ransomware attack in which data is stolen and then encrypted.

The attack on Xplain was on the 23rd. May by Watson publicly known. Among other things, the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol), the Federal Office of Customs and Border Security (BAZG) and various cantonal police are also affected.

Who is behind the hacker attack and data theft is not known. A corresponding threatening letter was published on the darknet page of the ransomware gang Play to put pressure on the victim. A few gigabytes of data have already been published there.

The attack on Xplain has no connection with the one on the parliament website last Wednesday, said a spokeswoman for the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSC) last Thursday.

Swiss companies do not want to report IT hacks because they distrust the federal government,2023-09-19,"Important companies such as Swisscom or SBB should better inform the state about cyber attacks, says Parliament. But the economy is in the way. In June, pro-Russian hackers paralyzed various federal websites. In the same month, hackers stole sensitive data from the company Xplain in Interlaken BE, which worked for the Confederation. The federal government had not checked the safety of the company once in the last 15 years, as this editorial team revealed last week. The federal credibility in terms of data security has been severely damaged since then at the latest. The incidents have given a new dimension to the discussion of the extent to which providers of important infrastructures should entrust sensitive data to the state. In the current autumn session, the parliamentary chambers are negotiating this issue within the framework of the new Information Security Act.

In principle, all parties involved agree: If hackers try to penetrate the systems of a critical infrastructure provider, the state must know this. This allows him to report the details as soon as possible to all other potentially threatened organizations so that they can take the necessary measures to protect them. In addition to the authorities of all three state levels, the operators of important infrastructures should also be subject to reporting for such an attack. These include, for example, energy companies, telecom companies, banks, but also the post office, SBB and the three state airports of Zurich, Basel and Geneva.

However, disagreement has ignited on the question of whether, in addition to attacks that have already taken place, they must also report vulnerabilities in their systems that they have discovered themselves. So far, this is voluntary. An example of this could be that an energy company has a security check carried out by a third-party company and that it comes across a poorly protected system.

A report to the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSC) would then be provided within 24 hours. That would probably be too little time for a company to fix the vulnerability before it has to report its existence to the NCSC.

""The danger is great that the reporting obligation for IT vulnerabilities does not strengthen the security of the systems of critical infrastructures, but potentially endangers it,"" wrote an alliance of 26 large companies and associations recently in a letter to all members of the National Council. A report of vulnerabilities and the associated collection at a central, state authority presupposes that the security system of that authority is absolutely safe.

The compromise probably fails

Then the authors of the letter mention the recent attacks on the federal government. The NCSC, whose communication channels to the infrastructure operators and their systems themselves, would become a worthwhile target for attackers through the proposed measure. If they were successful, they could potentially very easily penetrate the systems of several companies and cause great damage to them and the Swiss economy. The National Council did not heed the request of the companies and associations last week. The reporting obligation is too important in principle, found a clear center-left majority. She sent the law back to the Council of States with the order to work out a solution with which the economy could also come to an dear. The Council of States will decide on Tuesday.

A compromise is now up for discussion: According to this, weak points should also be reportable. But, among other things, the deadline for reporting is to be increased from 24 hours to 7 days. In many cases, this would be enough time to close the vulnerability yourself first.

In addition, reports should be submitted anonymously after the compromise proposal. So it would be more difficult for hackers, should they penetrate the communication channels to and from the NCSC, to locate the originally affected company.

However, the infrastructure managers reject the compromise proposal. It also fell significantly under the preliminary advisory commission of the Council of States. It is therefore likely that the affected companies will be able to keep their IT problems to themselves in the future, if no attack has taken place.",tagesanzeiger,http://tagesanzeiger.ch/search?q=SBB%20Cyberangriff,important companies swisscom sbb better inform state cyber attacks says parliament economy way june prorussian hackers paralyzed various federal websites month hackers stole sensitive data company xplain interlaken worked confederation federal government checked safety company last 15 years editorial team revealed last week federal credibility terms data security severely damaged since latest incidents given new dimension discussion extent providers important infrastructures entrust sensitive data state current autumn session parliamentary chambers negotiating issue within framework new information security act principle parties involved agree hackers try penetrate systems critical infrastructure provider state must know allows report details soon possible potentially threatened organizations take necessary measures protect addition authorities three state levels operators important infrastructures also subject reporting attack include example energy companies telecom companies banks also post office sbb three state airports zurich basel geneva however disagreement ignited question whether addition attacks already taken place must also report vulnerabilities systems discovered far voluntary example could energy company security check carried thirdparty company comes across poorly protected system report national center cyber security ncsc would provided within 24 hours would probably little time company fix vulnerability report existence ncsc danger great reporting obligation vulnerabilities strengthen security systems critical infrastructures potentially endangers wrote alliance 26 large companies associations recently letter members national council report vulnerabilities associated collection central state authority presupposes security system authority absolutely safe compromise probably fails authors letter mention recent attacks federal government ncsc whose communication channels infrastructure operators systems would become worthwhile target attackers proposed measure successful could potentially easily penetrate systems several companies cause great damage swiss economy national council heed request companies associations last week reporting obligation important principle found clear centerleft majority sent law back council states order work solution economy could also come dear council states decide tuesday compromise discussion according weak points also reportable among things deadline reporting increased 24 hours 7 days many cases would enough time close vulnerability first addition reports submitted anonymously compromise proposal would difficult hackers penetrate communication channels ncsc locate originally affected company however infrastructure managers reject compromise proposal also fell significantly preliminary advisory commission council states therefore likely affected companies able keep problems future attack taken place

SBB and canton of Aargau affected by data leak,2023-11-06,"The hacker group Play stole data from the federal railways and cantonal authorities. SBB does not say whether SBB customer data is also affected. SBB and the canton of Aargau are affected by a hacker attack. This is reported by the ""NZZ on Sunday"". The attackers took advantage of a vulnerability at the company Xplain. The Swiss company offers government software.
SBB confirms to Blick that it has been informed by Xplain that data has flowed away as part of a data leak. The federal railways do not want to say what kind of data is, as there are ""ongoing investigations"" about this, as a SBB spokesman explains. Public prosecutor's office affected?
It was known so far that the hackers captured data from the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol), the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (BAZG) and cantonal police. The cybercriminals apparently tried to blackmail the company Xplain. In the meantime, part of the data has been published on the darknet.
Another victim is the canton of Aargau. Data is also said to have been stolen from this, reports the ""NZZ am Sonntag"". In the past, the cantonal public prosecutor's office, the Office for Migration and Integration and the enforcement services, among others, have purchased the services of the software company.
Not the first cyber attack on SBB
The Aargau Department of Economics writes to the ""NZZ am Sonntag"" about the stolen data: ""According to today's state of knowledge, we assume that in addition to business correspondence, a small volume of operational data from error logs that were at Xplain for analysis is also affected."" The exact scope will be analyzed.
Behind the attack is said to be the hacker group Play, which in recent months also carried out cyber attacks on the media houses NZZ and CH-Media, among other things.In the process, the attackers invaded the computer system, stole data and encrypted it. Then the companies were blackmailed, in the case of non-payment, the data material was gradually published on the darknet.

Swiss government and Federal Railways hit by cyberattacks,2023-06-12,"Swiss federal government websites and the online portal of the Swiss Federal Railways have been victims of malicious online attacks.
Several websites of the federal administration are currently unavailable, Swiss public radio, SRF, reported on Monday.
According to the finance ministry, the sites were hit by a so-called DDoS attack, which aims to overload websites and applications with targeted requests so that they are no longer accessible. No data is lost in a DDoS attack.
The pro-Russian hacker group “NoName” has claimed responsibility for the attack on the federal government on its own Telegram channel, Tages-Anzeiger newspaper said. This group was also behind the attack on the Swiss parliament website (www.parlament.chExternal link) last week.
+ Ransomware attacks on the rise in Switzerland
“Federal IT specialists quickly noticed the attack and are taking steps to restore accessibility to websites and applications as quickly as possible,” the finance ministry said on Monday morning.
+ Hackers steal Swiss police and customs data
The Swiss Federal Railways and the Aargau cantonal authorities have also been affected by an earlier online attack against the Bern-based IT company Xplain, which provides services to federal and cantonal departments.
The national railway company and the canton confirmed to the Swiss News Agency Keystone-SDA that data had been stolen after a ransomware attack. This follows an earlier report in the NZZ am Sonntag newspaper.
The Aargau authorities say “a small volume of operational data linked to error protocols that were analysed at Xplain” is affected by the leak, as well as “commercial correspondence”.
The extent of the data theft is still being analysed by Xplain and the federal authorities. The hackers reportedly used malware to exploit a vulnerability on Xplain servers hosting applications for cantonal services. Ransomware usually blocks all access until a key or an unblocking tool is sent to the victim in exchange for a sum of money.
Far-reaching consequences
The attack on Xplain, revealed on May 23, has had far-reaching consequences. It has affected the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol), the Federal Office of Customs and Border Protection (FOCP) and, according to Le Temps, cantonal police forces. In addition to business correspondence, operational data may also have been affected, according to the National Centre for Cyber Security (NCSC).
After encrypting the stolen data and demanding a ransom from the company, the hackers reportedly published some of the data on the darknet. According to Le Temps, which broke the story, the attack was carried out by the Play group, the same group that recently targeted the Swiss media companies CH Media and NZZ.

Hacker finds data security weak spot in Swiss railway system,2022-01-24,"An anonymous hacker gained access to the personal data of thousands of passengers who bought tickets from Swiss Federal Railways. The embarrassing IT security weak spot in the Swisscard system, which has since been fixed, was reported to the Rundschau programmeExternal link on Swiss public television, SRF, on Monday.
The information included the names of the travellers, their date of birth, the number of first- and second-class tickets purchased and the place of departure and destination.
The hacker told Rundschau that the recent attack required no specialist IT knowledge: “The sensitive data was practically public on the internet.”
The data was never made public and has been returned to Swiss Railways. The hacker said they had no criminal intent but merely wanted to expose the problem.
The Federal Data Protection Commissioner was informed of the security breach.
‘Potential for abuse’
“This is a huge meltdown for Swiss Railways,” Otto Hostettler, a journalist and author specialising in internet crime, told Rundschau. “Such data can be sold in hacker forums on the dark web. In the wrong hands it would have great potential for abuse.”
This has been demonstrated by hacks into Swiss municipal databases in recent months, including the towns of Montreux and Rolle in western Switzerland.
The group that hacked the Rolle database posted information on the dark net and warned it could attack other towns, companies or hospitals.
Swiss news magazine Beobachter reported that 2,700 Swiss companies fell victim to ransomware hacks between August 2020 and August 2021. An article in Le Temps newspaper in December estimated that around 2,000 ransomware attacks targeted Switzerland last year.

The reason was a so-called DDoS attack on the systems of the federal administration.
Investigations by the Federal Prosecutor's Office are underway.
The specialists of the Federal Administration had quickly noticed the attack and taken measures to restore the accessibility of the websites and applications as quickly as possible, the Federal Department of Finance (EFD) announced.

The attack apparently applied to the entire federal administration, the National Center for Cyber Security (NCSC) announced on request. At times, a large part of the websites of the federal administration and federal companies as well as several federal applications were not available.

Criminal proceedings against hacker group

The group ""NoName"" has committed itself to the attack online. This group was also behind the attack on parlament.ch that became known last week. The NCSC did not provide any further information on the grouping. According to reports, it is said to be a Russian group.

Play Ransomware Attack on Xplain Impacts Swiss National Railway and Canton of Aargau,2023-06-14,"In a significant cybersecurity incident, the IT services provider Xplain experienced a Play ransomware attack that had a broader impact than initially estimated. The attack affected the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau, prompting a Swiss police investigation into Xplain.

Xplain, a Bernese IT company, serves various federal and cantonal government departments, the army, customs, and the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol). The attack on Xplain indirectly affected these major security entities as they all share the same IT service provider.

Threat actors initially published alleged stolen data from Fedpol and the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) on a Darknet forum. Local media reports suggest that the attackers exploited a vulnerability on Xplain's servers, leading to the Xplain data breach.

Fedpol confirmed the attack but stated that threat actors only accessed simulated, anonymous data used for testing purposes, and the agency's projects were not exposed. FOCBS acknowledged that data exposed in the breach were from correspondence with its clients.

The FSS data leak was first reported by NZZ am Sonntag magazine and later confirmed by the Swiss railway company. The authorities of the canton of Aargau confirmed the data breach and mentioned that a small volume of operational data from error logs at Xplain for analysis might also have been affected.

The investigation is ongoing to determine the full extent of the Play ransomware attack. In a separate incident, the website of the Swiss parliament faced a cyber attack, but it is not linked to the XPlay ransomware attack. The Swiss parliament reported that the attack had been neutralized, with no impact on internal systems or data.

The Xplain data breach, resulting from a Play ransomware attack, had a significant impact on the national Swiss railway company (FSS) and the canton of Aargau. The breach affected multiple government departments and security entities that share the same IT service provider.

XPLAIN DATA BREACH ALSO IMPACTED THE NATIONAL SWISS RAILWAY FSS,2023-06-18,"
The Play ransomware attack suffered by the IT services provider Xplain also impacted the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau.

The Play ransomware attack suffered by the IT services provider Xplain is worse than initially estimated, the incident also impacted the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau.

In early June, Swiss police launched an investigation into the cyber attack that hit the Bernese IT company Xplain, which provides its services to several federal and cantonal government departments, the army, customs, and the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol).

The news of the attack was first reported by the Swiss newspaper Le Temps.

“for the first time, several cantonal police forces, the Swiss army or the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) are indirectly affected by a cyberattack.” reads Le Temps. “These major players in security have one thing in common: they have the same IT service provider, the Bernese company Xplain, which has just been hacked.”

Threat actors initially published alleged stolen data from the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) and the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) on a Darknet forum.

Local media reported that attackers have exploited a vulnerability on the servers of the company.

Both Fedpol and the federal customs office confirmed the attack but attempted to downplay the incident. According to Fedpol, threat actors only had access to simulated, anonymous data for test purposes.

Xplain notified Fedpol about the attack a few days ago, revealed a Fedpol spokesman who added that the projects of the agency were not exposed.

The Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) said data from the FOCBS that were exposed are from correspondence with its clients.

The news of the FSS data leak was initially reported by the magazine NZZ am Sonntag and later confirmed by the Swiss railway company.

The authorities of the canton of Aargau also confirmed the data breach.

“The Aargau authorities said for their part that they assume that “in addition to company correspondence, a small volume of operational data from error logs which was at Xplain for analysis was also affected”.” reported the website RSI.

The authorities are still investigating the security breach to determine the extent of the attack.

This week, the website of the Swiss parliament has been the target of cyber attack as reported by the president of the House of Representatives, Martin Candinas.

“The problems appeared on Wednesday afternoon. At the end of the day, parliament’s services said the attack had been neutralised and that no internal systems or data had been affected.

XPLAIN DATA BREACH ALSO IMPACTED THE NATIONAL SWISS RAILWAY FSS,2023-06-12,"The Play ransomware attack suffered by the IT services provider Xplain also impacted the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau.
The Play ransomware attack suffered by the IT services provider Xplain is worse than initially estimated, the incident also impacted the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau.

In early June, Swiss police launched an investigation into the cyber attack that hit the Bernese IT company Xplain, which provides its services to several federal and cantonal government departments, the army, customs, and the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol).

The news of the attack was first reported by the Swiss newspaper Le Temps.

“for the first time, several cantonal police forces, the Swiss army or the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) are indirectly affected by a cyberattack.” reads Le Temps. “These major players in security have one thing in common: they have the same IT service provider, the Bernese company Xplain, which has just been hacked.”

Threat actors initially published alleged stolen data from the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) and the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) on a Darknet forum.

Local media reported that attackers have exploited a vulnerability on the servers of the company.

Both Fedpol and the federal customs office confirmed the attack but attempted to downplay the incident. According to Fedpol, threat actors only had access to simulated, anonymous data for test purposes.

Xplain notified Fedpol about the attack a few days ago, revealed a Fedpol spokesman who added that the projects of the agency were not exposed.

The Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) said data from the FOCBS that were exposed are from correspondence with its clients.

The news of the FSS data leak was initially reported by the magazine NZZ am Sonntag and later confirmed by the Swiss railway company.

The authorities of the canton of Aargau also confirmed the data breach.

“The Aargau authorities said for their part that they assume that “in addition to company correspondence, a small volume of operational data from error logs which was at Xplain for analysis was also affected”.” reported the website RSI.

The authorities are still investigating the security breach to determine the extent of the attack.

This week, the website of the Swiss parliament has been the target of cyber attack as reported by the president of the House of Representatives, Martin Candinas.

“The problems appeared on Wednesday afternoon. At the end of the day, parliament’s services said the attack had been neutralised and that no internal systems or data had been affected.

Xplain Hack Aftermath: Play Ransomware Leaks Sensitive Swiss Government Data,2024-03-07,"he Play ransomware group leaked around 65,000 documents belonging to the federal government, including classified documents and login credentials, which were published on its dark web leak site on 14 June 2023.Following the cyberattack on Swiss IT service provider, Xplain, details of the leaked data have been disclosed in a press release from the Swiss National Center for Cybersecurity (NCSC) – The Federal Office for Cybersecurity (BACS) has also taken part in the investigation.

The department analyzed the data leaked stolen by the Play ransomware group from Xplain, which is a “major provider of IT services to national and cantonal authorities,” the department confirmed.

Background

Back in May 2023, hackers exploited a vulnerability to target Xplain servers hosting applications for cantonal services, blocking access until a key or unblocking tool is sent in exchange for ransom. The attack, carried out by the Play ransomware group, had far-reaching consequences, impacting the Federal Office of Police, the Federal Office of Customs and Border Protection, Swiss Federal Railways and Aargau cantonal authorities.

In June 2023, Swiss federal government websites and the Swiss Federal Railways’ online portal were targeted in DDoS attacks, causing several websites to be unavailable. The finance ministry reported on 12 June 2023 that a pro-Russian group, “NoName,” claimed responsibility for the attack on its Telegram channel and that no data was lost in the attack. This group was also involved in the attack on the Swiss parliament website earlier in June 2023.

The Play ransomware group leaked around 65,000 documents belonging to the federal government, including classified documents and login credentials, which were published on its dark web leak site on 14 June 2023.

As per NCSC’s press release published earlier today, the BACS then took over the coordination of incident response within the federal administration and analysis of leaked data. A policy strategy crisis team was formed on 28 June and an administrative investigation was launched officially on 23 August to find out details of data leak at Xplain.Report Details

The BACS emphasized that the report focuses on data types and analysis challenges, not the content of leaked data. Around 70% (around 47,413) of files belong to Xplain and 14% (9,040) to the Federal Administration.  Hackers have leaked 95% of the 9040 files belonging to the Swiss federal government, mainly from the Federal Department of Justice and Police, Federal Office of Justice, Federal Office of Police, State Secretariat for Migration, and ISC-FDJP. 

Around half of the Federal Administration’s files contain sensitive content like personal data, technical information, classified information, and passwords, with 4,779 files containing personal data, and 278 files containing technical information. 121 objects were dubbed classified under the Information Protection Ordinance with 4 of them containing readable passwords.

The department aims to collaborate with authorities and Xplain to address potential consequences. This investigation is expected to be completed in March 2024.

"Switzerland: Play ransomware leaked 65,000 government documents",2024-03-07,"The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Switzerland has released a report on its analysis of a data breach following a ransomware attack on Xplain, disclosing that the incident impacted thousands of sensitive Federal government files.

Xplain is a Swiss technology and software solutions provider for various government departments, administrative units, and even the country's military force. The Play ransomware gang breached the company on May 23, 2023.

At the time, the threat actor claimed to have stolen documents containing confidential information, and in early June 2023, it followed through on its threats and published the stolen data on its darknet portal.The Swiss government started investigating the leaked files and instantly admitted that the leaked data might contain documents belonging to the Federal Administration of Switzerland.

In a new statement published today, the Swiss government confirmed that 65,000 government documents were leaked in the breach:

Out of approximately 1.3 million files published by Play ransomware, about 5% (65,000 documents) are relevant to the Federal Administration.
Most (95%) of those files impact the administrative units of the Federal Department of Justice and Police (FDJP): the Federal Office of Justice, the Federal Office of Police, the State Secretariat for Migration, and the internal IT service center ISC-FDJP.
The Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS) were minorly affected, accounting for just over 3% of that data.
Around 5,000 documents contained sensitive information, including personal data (names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and addresses), technical details, classified information, and account passwords.
A small set of a few hundred files contained IT system documentation, software or architectural data, and passwords.
The announcement says the administrative investigation, launched on August 23, 2023, is set to be completed by the end of this month, and the full results and cybersecurity recommendations will be shared with the Federal Council.

The investigation's extensive duration is attributed to the complexity of analyzing unstructured data and the large volume of the leaked data, which required significant time and resources to triage documents relevant to the Federal Administration.
Also, analyzing the leaked data for evidence is legally complicated, as confidential information requires inter-agency coordination and participation, inevitably prolonging the process.",bleepcomputer,https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/switzerland-play-ransomware-leaked-65-000-government-documents/,national cyber security centre ncsc switzerland released report analysis data breach following ransomware attack xplain disclosing incident impacted thousands sensitive federal government files xplain swiss technology software solutions provider various government departments administrative units even countrys military force play ransomware gang breached company may 23 2023 time threat actor claimed stolen documents containing confidential information early june 2023 followed threats published stolen data darknet portalthe swiss government started investigating leaked files instantly admitted leaked data might contain documents belonging federal administration switzerland new statement published today swiss government confirmed 65000 government documents leaked breach approximately 13 million files published play ransomware 5 65000 documents relevant federal administration 95 files impact administrative units federal department justice police fdjp federal office justice federal office police state secretariat migration internal service center iscfdjp federal department defence civil protection sport ddps minorly affected accounting 3 data around 5000 documents contained sensitive information including personal data names email addresses telephone numbers addresses technical details classified information account passwords small set hundred files contained system documentation software architectural data passwords announcement says administrative investigation launched august 23 2023 set completed end month full results cybersecurity recommendations shared federal council investigations extensive duration attributed complexity analyzing unstructured data large volume leaked data required significant time resources triage documents relevant federal administration also analyzing leaked data evidence legally complicated confidential information requires interagency coordination participation inevitably prolonging process
"Xplain Data Breach Hackers Leaked 65,000 Swiss Government Files",2024-03-15,"An inquiry into the May 2023 Xplain data breach found that 5% or 65,000 of the 1.3 million files the Play ransomware gang leaked were relevant to the Swiss government.The Play ransomware gang claimed it stole 907 gigabytes of sensitive documents, including financial records and other files.

On June 1, 2023, the cybergang dumped the entire trove on its darknet data leak site after failing to extort Xplain, a Swiss software solutions company that works with various government agencies.

Immediately, the Federal government admitted that the leaked files contained sensitive information and ordered an administrative investigation on August 23, 2023, of which the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) of Switzerland published these preliminary findings.Xplain data breach leaked over 65,000 Swiss government documents

The probe analyzed 1.3 million files published by the Play ransomware gang following the Xplain data breach and found that 5% or 65,000 files were relevant to the Federal government.

However, most files leaked “belonged to Xplain (47,413) with a share of over 70%; around 14% (9,040) belonged to the Federal Administration,” NCSC said.

Most (95%) of the leaked Swiss government files belonged to the administrative units of the Federal Department of Justice and Police, including the Federal Office of Justice, the Federal Office of Police, the State Secretariat for Migration, and the IT service center ISC-FDJP.

Another 3% of files exfiltrated during the Xplain ransomware attack affected the Federal Department of Defence, Civil Protection and Sport (DDPS), while other departments were “only marginally affected.”

Xplain data breach leaked sensitive personal and technical information

The NCSC found that over half (5,182) of the Swiss government files leaked after the Xplain data breach contained personal data, technical information, classified information, and account passwords.

Personal details, including names, email addresses, telephone numbers, and physical addresses, were present in 4,779 Swiss government files leaked in the Xplain data breach. Individuals whose personal information was leaked are at risk of targeted phishing attacks.

Of the 5,182 files, 278 contained “technical information such as documentation on IT systems, software requirement documents or architectural descriptions.” When leaked, this information could help threat actors plan future cyber attacks.

Another 121 files were classified according to the Information Protection Ordinance, meaning their contents could not be disclosed, while 4 had readable passwords. Compromised passwords are among the most prevalent initial access methods that threat actors, including Play ransomware, exploit to breach organizations.

While these findings are insightful, the Swiss government did not disclose the attack vector exploited in the Xplain data breach. However, the group exploits software vulnerabilities, remote desktop protocols (RDPs), virtual private networks (VPNs), and valid accounts to gain access.

The NCSC said a comprehensive analysis will conclude in late March 2024, and a conclusive report with detailed findings and recommendations will be shared with the Federal Council.

The cybersecurity agency also disclosed that the analysis team faced numerous challenges while analyzing the leaked files due to their unstructured nature, the sheer volume of data, and complex legal requirements that demanded inter-agency cooperation.

“Suitable tools were required to process unstructured data records and make their contents readable,” NCSC said. “The objects identified as relevant then had to be manually viewed and categorized.”

The Swiss government is among over 300 public and private organizations and critical infrastructure entities in North America, South America, and Europe targeted by Play ransomware (or Playcrypt) between June 2022 and October 2023, according to a joint cybersecurity advisory by the United States and Australia.

In mid-2022, the Play ransomware gang targeted government entities in Latin America and was attributed to the ransomware attack on the City of Oakland that leaked 600 gigabytes of data.

On April 24, 2023, the group also took credit for the ransomware attacks on Lowell, a city of over 100,000 inhabitants in Massachusetts, and Dallas County, Texas.

Swiss government data on the dark web after Play ransomware’s cyberattack on Xplain?,2023-06-09,"Swiss government data may have been posted on the dark web after a ransomware attack on software provider Xplain. The company has accused the ransomware gang Play of being behind the breach, but says it has no plans to pay the demanded ransom. Headquartered in Bern in Switzerland, Xplain delivers IT services to the Swiss Army and various national and regional government departments.

Switzerland cyberattack: government data leaked after Xplain breach

Police in Switzerland launched an investigation into the cyberattack at the ITSP earlier this week. Xplain said it believed the initial attack took place on Saturday and was carried out by Play. But having initially denied any government data was released as part of the breach, authorities in Zurich have now confirmed information may be available on the dark web.

“Xplain, a Swiss provider of government software, has been the victim of a ransomware attack,” said a government statement released on Thursday. “After the stolen data had been encrypted and the company blackmailed, the attackers posted some of the stolen data on the darknet.

“Contrary to the initial findings and following recent in-depth clarifications, it appears that operational data of the federal administration could also be affected. In-depth analyses are still ongoing.”

Xplain is publicly refusing to have any contact with the ransomware gang and says it will not pay the ransom. It has notified Switzerland’s National Cybersecurity Centre.

Tech Monitor has approached the company for comment but has received no response at the time of publication.

Swiss Railway company FSS affected by Xplain Data Breack: expanded impact of the cyberattack,2023-06-12,"Analysis Summary
In early June, the IT services provider Xplain, based in Bern, Switzerland, experienced a Play ransomware attack that had a more significant impact than initially anticipated. The attack not only affected Xplain, but also targeted the national railway company of Switzerland (FSS) and the canton of Aargau. Swiss police launched an investigation into the incident.

The news of the attack was first reported by Swiss newspaper Le Temps, which highlighted that several cantonal police forces, the Swiss army, and the Federal Office of Police (Fedpol) were indirectly impacted by the cyberattack. These entities shared a common IT service provider, Xplain, which had been hacked.

Threat actors initially published alleged stolen data from Fedpol and the Federal Office for Customs and Border Security (FOCBS) on a Darknet forum. Local media revealed that the attackers exploited a vulnerability in Xplain’s servers to carry out the attack.

Fedpol and the federal customs office confirmed the attack but downplayed its severity. Fedpol stated that the threat actors only accessed simulated, anonymous data used for testing purposes, ensuring that their projects remained unaffected. FOCBS acknowledged that some of their data exposed in the breach included correspondence with clients.

The FSS data leak was initially reported by NZZ am Sonntag magazine and later confirmed by the Swiss railway company. The authorities of the canton of Aargau also confirmed the data breach. Aargau authorities assumed that, in addition to company correspondence, a small amount of operational data from error logs, which were under analysis at Xplain, might have been affected.

The Aargau authorities said for their part that they assume that “in addition to company correspondence, a small volume of operational data from error logs which was at Xplain for analysis was also affected”, RSI reported.

The investigation into the security breach is still ongoing to determine the full extent of the attack and its implications for the affected organizations.

Additionally, during the same period, the website of the Swiss parliament faced a separate cyber attack. The president of the House of Representatives, reported that problems were encountered in accessing the website. However, the attack on the parliament’s website was not linked to the Xplain ransomware attack. Parliament’s services stated that the attack had been neutralized, assuring that no internal systems or data had been affected, although some access issues persisted temporarily.

Overall, the incident involving Xplain’s Play ransomware attack had far-reaching consequences, affecting not only Xplain but also the FSS, the canton of Aargau, and indirectly impacting various government entities in Switzerland.
